This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick start

Install backend and front end dependencies and start servers.

### Dummie backend

The backend needed to get this project to work is in `server` directory.

```bash
1) get into server folder: "$ cd server"
2) Install npm packages: "$ npm install"
3) Start node server: "$ node server.js"
```

A server will be launched in `http://localhost:9003/`

### Front-end

```bash
1) Install npm packages: "$ npm install"
2) Start webpack: "$ yarn start"
```

## All available scripts in front side

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
